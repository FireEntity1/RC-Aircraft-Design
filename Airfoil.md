FLAT PLATE
Stall Speed @5 degrees: 16km/h: 
Stall Angle @ 30km/h: Approx +23.3 degrees

CURVED (Under-cambered) PLATE
Stall Speed: 10km/h:
Stall Angle @ 30km/h: Approx. 24 degrees

An increase of camber results in increased lift capability at an increase of drag and reduce of structural integrity

No camber (flat bottomed) airfoil is ideal for simple construction, speed, and integrity at the cost of a higher stall speed.

Electronics will be housed inside the aircraft to minimize turbulent airflow, especially over wing and tail sections.

Airfoil design: Kline-Foglemen-2 Step Airfoil @ 50% Camber

Flight Characteristics: Slow-Medium speed, stall speed low
