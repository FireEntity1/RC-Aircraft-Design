I built a fully controllable, self propelled electric RC aircraft, capable of flying up to 80km/h (tested) at an altitude of several thousand feet (theoretical). The entire aircraft weighs a mere 250 grams so it's legal to fly without any license around the world! Flies smoothly with its 3 channel control system, consisting of throttle control, rudder control, and elevator control. The wings have a polyhedral design allowing the aircraft to stabilize itself laterally and remove the need for ailerons! An oversized rudder allows for precise control and "drifting" mid-air! The propeller, which is 6 inches in diameter with a 4 inch pitch is capable of spinning at 17 thousand RPM on a full battery, while the motor pulls ~40-50 watts. The aircraft is controlled with a 2.4gHz TX/RX system. Winglets (triangles on the wingtip) improve aerodynamic efficiency by reducing wingtip vorticies and add major style points! Fully decorated with decals, stripes, and a faux aircraft registration drawn on the body! The aircraft has a wingspan of nearly 3 feet.
Entering a deep stall is nearly impossible due to the nature of the aircraft, almost any mistake can be recovered if flown at a height of ~30-50 feet!

# Building it Yourself!:

To build your own RC aircraft similar to this one, download the pdf file labelled "plans" and print it out. On A4/Letter paper the drawing should be tiled to scale. Tape the plans together and cut out foamboard as the plans say!

### Ideal electronics:
 - 2204-size 2300kV brushless motor
 - 2x 9g servos
 - 2.4gHz transmitter/receiver
 - 2s/3s LiPo battery, 800-1200mAh
 - 15A speed controller (ESC)


### Build instructions
  - Screw the motor into anything light, thin, and sturdy, ideally a 3D printed mount, although a piece of wood with a hole drilled through it for the shaft would work as well. | Attatch the motor mount and propeller in the provided area outlined by the plans.
  - Attatch the servo arms to the control surfaces with control rods! | Servos should be taped or glued in with the arms being able to move fully
  - Make a tight area in the nose section of the aircraft for the battery, or on top. | Make sure it is protected as LiPos can be dangerous if punctured!
  - **Center of gravity should be 3.5-4 inches from the leading edge of the wing, this is extremely important, if your center of gravity is off, the aircraft will not fly**
  - Not much control surface throw (amount the control surfaces move) is needed, 15 degrees for rudder and elevator control each way should suffice.

  Once the aircraft is built and balanced, make sure the control surfaces move in the right direction. Pulling the elevator stick towards you should make the elevator on the aircraft tilt up, and vice versa. Moving the rudder stick to the right should make the rudder tilt to the right, and vice versa.

Test the aircraft with short flights and make adjustments as needed before taking it for a full flight, fly gently and do not make harsh movements on the control sticks

Decorate it as you please! Just remember to keep the weight low and not cover/damage sensitive electronics.

Thank you for reading and happy building!!
