# RC Aircraft Design

To build your own RC aircraft similar to this one, download the pdf file labelled "plans" and print it out. On A4/Letter paper the drawing should be tiled to scale. Tape the plans together and cut out foamboard as the plans say!

### Ideal electronics:
 - 2204-size 2300kV brushless motor
 - 2x 9g servos
 - 2.4gHz transmitter/receiver
 - 2s/3s LiPo battery, 800-1200mAh
 - 15A speed controller (ESC)


### Build instructions
  - Screw the motor into anything light, thin, and sturdy, ideally a 3D printed mount, although a piece of wood with a hole drilled through it for the shaft would work as well. | Attatch the motor mount and propeller in the provided area outlined by the plans.
  - Attatch the servo arms to the control surfaces with control rods! | Servos should be taped or glued in with the arms being able to move fully
  - Make a tight area in the nose section of the aircraft for the battery, or on top. | Make sure it is protected as LiPos can be dangerous if punctured!
  - **Center of gravity should be 3.5-4 inches from the leading edge of the wing, this is extremely important, if your center of gravity is off, the aircraft will not fly**
  - Not much control surface throw (amount the control surfaces move) is needed, 15 degrees for rudder and elevator control each way should suffice.

  Once the aircraft is built and balanced, make sure the control surfaces move in the right direction. Pulling the elevator stick towards you should make the elevator on the aircraft tilt up, and vice versa. Moving the rudder stick to the right should make the rudder tilt to the right, and vice versa.

Test the aircraft with short flights and make adjustments as needed before taking it for a full flight, fly gently and do not make harsh movements on the control sticks

Decorate it as you please! Just remember to keep the weight low and not cover/damage sensitive electronics.

Thank you for reading and happy building!!

Feel free to reach out with any questions regarding construction or flight!
